### A TUI Weather App Built In Pure C!
All of the following has yet to be implemented, but heres the plan:
1. You must get a [Bing Maps key](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/getting-started/bing-maps-dev-center-help/getting-a-bing-maps-key)
   * Allows converting a zip code into longitude & latitude
   * The GET request works. I just need to parse the XML for the coordinates
2. Use [api.weather.gov](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api)
   * Turns the aforementioned coordinates into usable weather data
   * Parse this data and present it in the terminal as a TUI
3. \$\$\$ Profit \$\$\$

### Sounds EZ, right...
### Right?
